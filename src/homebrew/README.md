# Homebrew (homebrew)

Installs Homebrew

## Example Usage

```json
"features": {
    "ghcr.io/meaningful-ooo/devcontainer-features/homebrew:2": {}
}
```

## Options

| Options Id | Description | Type | Default Value |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| shallowClone | Install Homebrew using shallow clone. Shallow clone allows significant reduction in the installation size at the expense of not being able to run `brew update`, which effectively means the package index will be frozen at the moment of the image creation. | boolean | false |
